This assignment was run on python 3.5.
Virtual Env: Anaconda 
Environment: Windows 10
IDE: Spyder

#For other person to use the environment
conda env create -f <environment-name>.yml

I have attached 2 files for running my code:
	environment.yml
	requirements.txt

environment.yml is used to create a similar anaconda environment as the one I have.
requirements.txt lists all the libraries used and their corresponding versions.

The main code for my datasets are:
	main.py (main function for the whole problem)
	preprocess.py (helper function for preprocessing both datasets)
